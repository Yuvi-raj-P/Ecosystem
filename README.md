# Ecosystem

A three js site with Water simulation, Stars twinkle shader, Boids simulation, Trig animation, gltf models and too many shaders. The whole website is done with website graphics and webgl three js with react as a framwork.
Sorry I couldnot deploy the site on time because high seas was ending and I am crashing out right now and the project is very big to deploy in given time so yeah.

So below are the demos for the projects. Please vote this is been a crazy amount of work!
